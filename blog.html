            Why it matters to use relative size(%,em,rem) when styling the size of an element in our site ?
        </p>

        <article>
            <p>Nowadays, people browse the web using different devices that vary in size and shape. That's why we're in need of websites that scale accoriding to the device. We have an option in tackling this problem. We can design different apperances for different devices or make the size of elements relative to the device size. When we take a look at the first option, it's a lot more work and time consuming because we have to redesign our website for one or more devices. The second option is a lot quicker and easier. Another plus is the fact it will render well on new devices that might come out. On the other option, we're gonna have to reevaluate every time a new screen size becomes a trend.</p>
            <p>Some of our visitors might have a visual condition where they require bigger fonts to read. As such, they will often change the browser's default. If we use non-relative size, the font will not change making our website unusable for these users. We can avoid that problem by using relative size. Another option for these users maybe the zoom feature but on older browsers this feature is unable to resize text that was sized pixels. This leads to conclusion we should use relative size units.</p>

                <em>"16px"</em> Default Browser Width and What It Means
            </p>
    
            <article>
                <p>16px is the browser's default width because any webpage's <em>body</em> element has by default a margin of 8px. Counting 8px for both left and right margins gives us a default width of 16px. If we want to completely in charge of our page's design, it is recommended to set this values first.</p>
                <p>1 px (pixel) is defined at 96 DPI (dots per inch) which is approximately equal to 0.265 millimeters on your screen. For example, if you specify the size of an element at 200px any browser will interpret as take a size of 53mm or 5.3cm on the screen regardless of screen size.</p>

                    Evolving to CSS3
                </p>
        
                <article>
                    <p>With CSS3 there have come some changes and I will try to cover them now.</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li><h4>Selectors</h4></li>
                        <p>Since selectors are at the core of CSS, they have been expanded to an extent. The attribute selectors, introduced in CSS2, have a new mechanism where we don't have to type the full value of the attribute. For example, we can use <em>a[href^="http://sales"]</em> to find links whose sources begin with sales; we can also use <em>$=</em> and <em>*=</em> to signify ends with and contains respectively. Another type of selectors that got extended are pseudo-selectors (:hover, :visited). For example, <em>:last-child</em> has been added as a compliment to <em>:first-child</em>.</p>
                        
                        <li><h4>Colors</h4></li>
                        <p>CSS3 offers up new methods of picking colors like <em>hsl</em>, <em>hsla</em> and <em>rgba</em> which have the ability to declare semi-transparent colors. <em>rgba</em> works like <em>rgb</em> with an added parameter for alpha (opacity). <em>hsl</em> stands for hue, saturation and lightness allowing for advanced manipulation while <em>hsla</em> just adds opacity to HSL.</p>

                        <li><h4>Animations and Text Effects</h4></li>
                        <p>Animations that do not require JavaScript have been included in CSS3. To get it working, you must first define a keyframe which acts like a function. Take the following as an example.
                             <br><em>@keyframes example {
                            <br>&#8195 from {background-color: red;}
                            <br>&#8195 to {background-color: yellow;}
                          <br>}</em><br> Then you should bind it to an element to get it working using the syntax <em>animation: example;</em> . You can even set the duration with the <em>animation-duration</em> property. To make your animation based on user input you can couple it with the pseudo-selector <em>:hover</em> .</p>
                        <p>Another new feature is the text effects. These include attributes <em>text-overflow, word-wrap, word-break, writing-mode
                            </em> .</p>

                        <li><h4>Viewport Height / Width</h4></li>
                        <p>In CSS3 you can use new relative sizes <em>vw</em> and <em>vh</em>, viewport width and viewport height respectively. <em>1 vw / vh</em> equals 1 / 100 times the viewport's width / height.</p>

                        <li><h4>Rounded Corners</h4></li>
                        <p>CSS3 features a new attribute called <em>border-radius</em> that enables you to curve your border. At 100%, it will turn into a circle.</p>
                  
                        <li><h4>Gradients</h4></li>
                        <p>Using this new syntax <em>background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);</em> you will be able to apply linear gradients as a background image. For radial gradients use the syntax <em>background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);</em> .</p>

                        <li><h4>Multiple Background Images</h4></li>
                        <p>CSS3 now supports multiple background images. To use this feature just follow this syntax: <em>background-image: url(...), url(...), ...;</em></p>
      
                    </ul>
